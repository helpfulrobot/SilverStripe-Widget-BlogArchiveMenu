## Introduction
Based on the Archive Widget it shows blog entries by date with a menu look and feel.
Through the CMS you can set for how many of the past years each month with a blog entry should be shown. For all older blog entries only the year is shown.

##Example
When 'Another blog entry' is viewed, the following menu is shown:
    January 2012
        Latest blog entry
        Another blog entry
        A blog entry
    December 2011
    November 2011
    October 2011
    September 2011
    August 2011
    July 2011
    June 2011
    May 2011
    April 2011
    March 2011
    February 2011
    January 2011
    2010
    2009
    2008

In this case the latest blog entry is in January 2012 and 'Nr of years to show all months for' is set to 2.
